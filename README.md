# Assignment 1
**Name :** Jagad WIjaya Purnomo  
**NRP :** 05111940000132  
  
In this task, we are asked to look for objects with the provisions that have been given, namely object whose name starts with E, J, or O (in English). After that, we must take photos of the thing from four different perspectives: top right, top left, top rear, top front of an image of the object like what I had done below. I chose **Eraser** to be an object for this assignment.

| Top Left | Top Left-Rear | Top Right-Front | Top-Rear | Above |

# Assignment 2  
From the object or image that I had from the previous task, in this task we were asked to select two of the four perspective images of those objects. So, I choosed the **top left** and **top right-front** perspective of the image object. Then from that image or photos we must to illustrated it using WebGL-based Graphics application in accordance with the following provisions :    
1. The application consists of HTML, JavaScript and CSS (optional) files.  
2. The application contains only one Canvas.  
3. The JavaScript application comprises the definition of vertices that embody the shape of the object photographed in the previous assignment: Select two of the four photos.  
4. The definition of vertex includes position (x, y) and color (r, g, b) as represented on the selected photos.  
5. The shape as shown on one of the selected photos is rendered on the left side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between X = -1.0 and X = 0.0 axes.  
6. The shape as shown in another selected photo is rendered on the right side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between X = 0.0 and X = 1.0 axes.  
7. The rendering result on the right side of the Canvas is animated vertically, bouncing back between the top and the bottom walls of the Canvas, with a speed of 0.0xxx units, where xxx is the last three digits of the NRP.  
8. Do not forget to commit and push the changes.

# Assignment 3  
1. Create a 3D definition of the object being photographed in your very first assignment.
2. Draw the object twice—on the left and on the right half of the canvas—with the two perspectives corresponding to the two photos selected in the previous assignment.
3. Add a little cube in the center of canvas, right between the two objects.
4. Set the cube to glow white and become a light source.
5. Add an ambient effect with an intensity of 0.abc to both objects, where the value of abc is the last three digits of your Student ID plus 200.
6. Add a diffuse effect to both objects. 
7. Add a plastic specular effect for the left object. 
8. Add a metal specular effect for the object on the right. 
9. Set the cube so that it can be moved upward with the W key-button and downward with the S key-button. 
10. Set the camera to move leftward and rightward linearly (not orbitally) using the A and D key-buttons.
